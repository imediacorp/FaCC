# The Golden Ratio in Space: Quick Summary

**What:** We're searching for patterns in how galaxies are arranged that follow the golden ratio (1.618).

**Why:** The golden ratio appears everywhere in nature (flowers, shells, spiral galaxies). We want to know if it also appears in the largest structures of the universe.

**How:** Using data from DESI telescope that maps millions of galaxies, we'll look for subtle mathematical patterns.

**When:** Forecasts show we can test this with data available 2025-2027.

**Significance:** If found, it connects small-scale natural patterns to cosmic structure. If not found, it helps rule out possibilities and refine our understanding.

**Bottom Line:** Either way, we learn something important about how the universe works.
