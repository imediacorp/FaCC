# Project Independence Statement

This cosmological research project (**Fibonacci Cosmology / φ-Modulation Analysis**) is completely independent and separate from any other research projects, including but not limited to any work related to HDPD, CHaDD2, or any other Fibonacci-related modules or inventions.

## Origin and Motivation

This work originated as a simple **thought experiment and hypothesis** that the Golden Ratio (φ ≈ 1.618, derived from the Fibonacci sequence) might be fundamental to cosmic structure, motivated by the observation that self-similarity patterns appear across scales—from plant growth patterns to galactic spiral structures.

## Independent Development

- This cosmological theory was developed independently as a cosmological hypothesis
- It focuses specifically on testing whether φ manifests in cosmic structure formation
- The methodology, analysis, and conclusions are entirely separate from any other work
- No code, data, or methodology is shared or linked with other projects

## Scope

This repository contains:
- Tests of φ-recursion in cosmic expansion history (background model, now falsified)
- Tests of φ-modulated perturbations in structure formation (testable perturbation model)
- DESI forecast analysis for detecting φ-modulation in matter power spectra
- Fisher matrix methodology for quantifying detectability

## Separation from Other Work

While the Golden Ratio (Fibonacci sequence) may appear in various contexts across different fields and projects, this cosmological research represents a completely independent line of inquiry focused specifically on:
1. Whether φ appears in cosmic expansion (ruled out)
2. Whether φ appears in structure formation perturbations (testable)

Any similarity to other Fibonacci-related work is purely coincidental and reflects the ubiquity of φ in mathematics and nature, not any shared codebase, methodology, or research connection.
