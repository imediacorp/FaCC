- **P(k)**: SDSS/BOSS linear matter power spectrum
- **CMB**: Planck 2018 low-ℓ temperature anisotropies

## Falsifiability Statement

This work is explicitly designed to be falsifiable:

1. The background Fibonacci model **has been falsified** (Δχ² = 1364)
2. The perturbation model makes **specific predictions** testable by 2026-2030
3. If no φ-oscillations detected at >3σ by DESI Y6, Euclid, or CMB-S4, the perturbation hypothesis will also be considered falsified

*"The background model is dead. But log-periodic perturbations offer a new, testable window into recursive cosmology. We predict detection within 5 years. If confirmed, φ governs structure, not expansion. If not, the idea dies again — cleanly."*
