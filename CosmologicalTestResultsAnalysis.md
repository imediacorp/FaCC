## Key Results Summary

| Test | Fibonacci Model | ΛCDM | Status |
|------|----------------|------|--------|
| H(z) χ² | 1379 | 14.6 | ❌ FAILED |
| H₀ (km/s/Mpc) | 12.37 | 68.17 | ❌ FAILED |
| Λ (m⁻²) | 4.82×10⁻³⁷ | — | ❌ 15 orders too large |
| P(k) φ-scales | 1/11 weak | — | ❌ FAILED |
| CMB amplitude | 0.0σ | — | ❌ FAILED |

**Conclusion:** Background model falsified. Perturbation model testable within 5 years.
