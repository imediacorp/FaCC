Phi Modulation Analysis Framework

A scientifically defensible framework for testing φ-modulation
as an empirical pattern in cosmic structure.

This cosmological research work is independent and separate from any other projects.
It originated as a thought experiment and hypothesis exploring whether the Golden Ratio
might be fundamental to cosmic structure, given self-similarity patterns observed
from plants to galaxies.
